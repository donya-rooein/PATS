## Project overview

**PATS** investigates how tutoring responses can be adapted to learner characteristics—specifically personality-related signals—when generating instructional dialogue with LLM tutors. The repository includes:
- notebooks / scripts used for analyses,
- annotated data needed to reproduce figures/tables (where redistributable),
- a `Demo/` directory intended for a simple web-facing artifact.
