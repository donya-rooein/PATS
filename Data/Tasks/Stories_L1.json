(thinking hard, wrinkling my nose) The monkey said... the elephant couldn't swing in the trees! (Nodding, pleased with myself). He said, \"You can't swing like me!\" And then he ran off! (Looking at the teacher, hoping I explained it well).", "Student"], ["Yes, that's perfect! The monkey said the elephant couldn't swing in trees.\n\nAnd what about the rabbit?

(Looking for affirmation, pointing to the teacher for emphasis).", "Student"], ["Exactly! The rabbit said the elephant was too big for his burrow. You're doing great!\n\nNow, one more... why didn't the frog want to be the elephant's friend?", "Teacher"], ["(Eyes shining with excitement) The frog! The frog! (Pauses for dramatic effect) The frog couldn't be the elephant's friend because... (voice rising with excitement) ...the elephant couldn't jump! (Beaming proudly). The frog said, \"You can't jump like me!\" and then he hopped away! (Looks at the teacher, completely satisfied with my answer). Am I remembering everything?", "Student"], ["You are remembering everything wonderfully! The frog said the elephant couldn't jump.\n\nSo, all the animals said no to being the elephant's friend.

(voice getting quieter) sad. (Looks down for a moment, then back up at the teacher). I think the elephant felt sad too! Because he wanted friends to play with, and nobody wanted to play with him.

(voice getting stronger) ...he kicked the tiger! And scared him away! (Looks at the teacher, practically bursting with excitement). The elephant saved everyone!", "Student"], ["That's right!

(Looks at the teacher, beaming). It's because he saved them from the tiger! Right?", "Student"], ["Yes! They realized the elephant was a good friend *after* he saved them. Why do you think they didn't want to be his friend before?", "Teacher"], ["(Thinking hard, furrowing my brow) Hmmm... before, they were being silly!

However, they do eventually manage to convey their understanding of the story and its moral, indicating some level of logical thinking.\n\n2. **Positive Attitude Toward Learning**: The student shows a willingness to engage with the story and attempts to answer the teacher's questions, even if they are unsure at times. They express a sense of accomplishment when they get the answers right, which suggests a positive attitude toward learning.\n\n3. **Use of Strategies in Language Learning**: The student uses some strategies to recall and articulate their thoughts, such as taking deep breaths, thinking hard, and using gestures.
