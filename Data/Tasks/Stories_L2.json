(Looks up, a spark of understanding in my eyes) I think... I think it means you should be careful with what you have *now*.

It's like... like selling someone a car but keeping the wheels!", "Student"], ["That's a *perfect* way to explain it! Selling a car but keeping the wheels! The neighbour *was* being tricky.\n\nSo, what happened when the farmer went to the emperor? What did the emperor's helper (the courtier) say to the neighbour?", "Teacher"], ["(Sitting up straight, eager to answer) The courtier! Yes! He was very smart!

Or... or he had to pay the farmer rent for keeping his water in the farmer's well! (Smiles triumphantly) That was a really good idea, because the neighbor couldn't do that! It was too much water!", "Student"], ["Excellent! You remembered all the important parts.

The elephant was too big again! (Giggles)", "Student"], ["You are doing a super job!

(Looks around, then back at the teacher) I think... (pauses, thinking) ...I think it's saying that... that even if someone is different, they can still be a good friend.

It's good to talk about feelings, because it helps us understand the story, and it helps us understand each other!\n\nSo, King Midas was hungry. He was mad. And maybe a little scared.

It's...it's not fair! (Muffled sobs). He didn't mean to!", "Student"], ["You're right, it wasn't fair. It was a very sad thing that happened.\n\nNow, why do you think his daughter turned to gold?", "Teacher"], ["(Sniffles, lifts head, eyes red and puffy, but dries eyes with fists) Because... because he... he had the stupid... gold touch!

He couldn't hug his daughter! (Voice rising again, starting to get agitated). It was a *stupid*, selfish wish! (Takes a deep breath, trying to calm down). He... he thought gold was the most important thing, but... but it wasn't. It made everything worse. (Looks at you with a mixture of sadness and anger).

She was dumb! (giggles)", "Student"], ["(Smiling encouragingly)\n\nYou got them all! Yes, there's the farmer, the goose, and the farmer's wife.\n\nWhy do you think the wife was dumb? What did she do?", "Teacher"], ["(Rolls eyes) Duh! (crosses arms) She agreed with the farmer! He wanted more eggs, and she said okay! (voice rising) Like, hello?! One golden egg a day is, like, a LOT! (jumps in seat) She should have told him he was being stupid! (looks away, fidgeting) Now they're both poor! Serves them right!", "Student"], ["(Nodding gently)\n\nOkay, so you think she made a bad choice by agreeing with the farmer. Why was wanting more eggs a bad idea? What was happening *before* they wanted more?", "Teacher"], ["(Sighs dramatically) Ugh, you're making me think! (taps fingers on the desk) Before? (pauses, thinking) They were... rich-ish? (looks up, confused) No, not rich. Comfortable! Yeah, comfortable. They had enough money 'cause of the golden egg. (shrugs) So, like, why mess with that? (scowls) The farmer was just greedy! Stupid farmer! (kicks chair slightly)", "Student"], ["(Calmly)\n\nYou're right, they were comfortable! The golden egg helped them have enough. And you said the farmer was greedy. What does \"greedy\" mean?", "Teacher"], ["(Puffs out cheeks) Greedy means... (thinks hard, brow furrowed) Wanting MORE! (eyes light up) Like, WAY more than you need!

He's a big, fat... (stops abruptly, looks around nervously) ...meanie!", "Student"], ["(Chuckles softly)\n\nOkay, yes! That's a great example. Timmy is being greedy!

(makes gagging noises) ...blood! And guts! (shudders) The poor goose! (voice softens slightly, but then quickly returns to being loud) And NO golden eggs! Ha! Serves him right! Now he has nothing! He's probably crying now! (laughs loudly) I bet his wife is super mad!", "Student"], ["(Nodding)\n\nHe found a big mess, didn't he? And no more golden eggs. So, before, they were comfortable because of the goose. And after, they were... what?", "Teacher"], ["(Leans back in chair, swinging legs) They were... (snaps fingers) ...POOR! (grins) Super poor! Poorer than dirt! They lost everything because the farmer was greedy! (eyes gleam mischievously) Maybe they had to sell their house and live in a cardboard box! (laughs again) That would be funny!", "Student"], ["(Gently)\n\nIt's not very nice to laugh at their misfortune, even if they made a mistake. But you're right, they became very poor.
